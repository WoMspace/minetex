# MineTeX Document Specification
A very simple TeX-inspired typesetter for Minecraft Written Books.
It serves two purposes â€” converting existing text documents easily into strictly paginated Minecraft books,
and to author new Minecraft books without spending half of the time dealing with page limitations.
## Commands
### Styles
Command styles are applied until the next line break or page, or until the reset command is given.
- `\colour{<colour>}` applies the given colour to the following text. See below for allowed colours.
- `\bold` makes the following text bold.
- `\italic` makes the following text italic.
- `\underline` underlines the following text.
- `\garble` makes the following text animated garbled.
- `\reset` resets all styles immediately.

### Layout
- `\pagebreak` forces a page break even if it otherwise would not.
- `\align{<mode>}` forces the line(s) to be aligned according to the given mode. Allowed modes are `left`, `right`, `center`, and `justify`.

## Colours
Minecraft books have 16 available colours, including the default black.

## Styles
Minecraft books offer limited styling, but include the basics: bold, italic, underlined,
as well as a Minecraft-unique style which garbles the text so it is unreadable, and is also animated.
